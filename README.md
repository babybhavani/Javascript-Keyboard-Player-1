<h3 style="color:whitesmoke;text-align:center;font-family:Roboto">PROJECT1 : DRUM KIT </h3>
<p style="color:white; font-size:15px;text-align:justify;">I've finished the Drum Kit, the challenge's initial project. For this project, a virtual drum set was made, with a separate drum sound assigned to each note on the keyboard. It was an excellent practice in event handling and DOM manipulation.</p>
<p style="color:white; font-size:15px;text-align:justify;><b>What you'll discover...</b>
<h3>HTML</h3>
<ul type="disc">
<li>First of all I've created a HTML file with a container element and gave a class name as container. This element contains all keys of the drum kit.</li>
<li>Now I took another container element inside the element with class name container. Inside this container placed a kbd tag which contains the key or alphabet. I've used a data- attribute as data-key and given the ASCII value of alphabet inorder to access the Keycode of the alphabet.</li>
<li>Used same format for all 26 characters.</li></ul>
