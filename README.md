<p style="color:white; font-size:15px;text-align:center;">I've finished the Drum Kit, the challenge's initial project. For this project, a virtual drum set was made, with a separate drum sound assigned to each note on the keyboard. It was an excellent practice in event handling and DOM manipulation.</p>
